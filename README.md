# :snake: Snake Remastered :snake:
## :arrow_forward: Introduction
Matrix project for Introduction to Robotics course, taken in 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. The project consists in creating a game on the 8x8 matrix with a menu displayed on the LCD display.

## :newspaper: Backstory
I wanted to create this game because it reminds me of my childhood when I used to ask my parents for a Nokia phone to play snake.

## :memo: Description
This is a remastered snake game. As with snake, move the joystick to change the direction of the snake and eat the food to grow.

## :video_game: How to play
It has 3 levels of difficulty :
  - Easy: the speed is constant and low making it easy to eat the food and there are no obstacles that can end the game
  - Medium: the speed is constant, but higher than in the previous level and once the score of 5 is reached, 2x1 walls will appear on the matrix that cannot be passed through
  - Hard: speed increases with each food eaten and once the score of 3 is reached, 2x1 walls will appear on the matrix that cannot be passed through
